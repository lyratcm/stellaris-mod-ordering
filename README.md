Welcome to the stellaris mod ordering tool

Warning: does not currently work for mac or linux, is not translated into any other languages

To use, download the file (order_mods.zip) from releases, unzip and run order_mods.exe in the output folder

The mod list should be obtained by exporting the mod list from the stellaris launcher (or irony) by going to playsets - the dots in the left hand corner - share - download file (this will not include any local mods). 
in file explorer shift-right click - copy as path and insert that path into the program

I am currently working on this tool for my university master project so would appreciate it if you filled in this survey to give feedback on how I've done. 
I will be opening the project up to commits after the project is complete
